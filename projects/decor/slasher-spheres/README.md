# The Slasher Sphere Collection: Horror-Themed Pokéballs

High-precision, multi-part 3D prints merging the world of Pokémon with iconic horror film slashers. Designed for seamless assembly and a premium, prop-quality feel.

This collection utilizes parametric OpenSCAD engineering to transform 2D horror motifs into 3D spherical objects. By utilizing a high-precision friction-fit system, these spheres are optimized for clean, multi-color results without the need for a multi-material system (like an AMS or MMU).

## 🧬 The "Slasher" DNA (Universal Specs)

To ensure consistency across the entire collection, every sphere in this project adheres to these baseline engineering rules:

- **The Fit:** High-precision friction fits. Structural parts and mask chips now use a tight `0.05mm` clearance to minimize the need for glue.
- **The Stability:** All bottom shells feature a integrated **flattened base** to ensure the props sit securely on flat surfaces without rolling.
- **The Shells:** Standardized `80mm` diameter (40mm radius).
- **The Seam:** **Back-seam alignment is required.** Slicers must be set to place the Z-seam at the back to keep the front face and hardware mating surfaces clean.
- **The Walls:** Requires **3 to 4 wall perimeters** to ensure the recessed feature pockets have a solid plastic backing.
- **The Squish:** _Elephant Foot Compensation_ is mandatory (set to `0.15mm`).

## 🛠 Collection-Wide Assembly Tips

- **Internal Alignment:** Every sphere uses a standardized **Rectangular Filler Peg**. This provides massive surface area for structural stability and ensures the hemispheres never twist.
- **Support-Free Design:** All spheres are designed to be printed with the equatorial flat faces down on the build plate. This allows the organic curves of the ball to print flawlessly without supports.
- **The Finish:** Detail chips (eyes, chevrons, etc.) are dimensioned to sit slightly proud of the shell surface for a deliberate, high-quality look.
- **Minimal Glue:** While the friction fit is designed to hold on its own, a tiny drop of CA glue can be used if your printer's tolerances are running loose.
